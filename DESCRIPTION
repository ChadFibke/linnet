Title: Groups SARS-CoV-2 Lineages with Directed Networks

Description: Collects current SARS-CoV-2 PANGO lineage child-parent relations 
    from outbreak.info and repersents them as a directed network structure. The
    package leverages this evolutionary relationship to cluster SARS-CoV-2 
    lineages into parental lineages based on a specified threshold or target 
    number of lineages. The aggregation can highlight predominant lineages for 
    downstream analytical, visualization, or reporting workflows.
